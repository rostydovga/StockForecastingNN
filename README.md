This repository houses a collection of notebooks showcasing various Neural Network models that were featured in my Bachelor's degree final examination. Each notebook is dedicated to a specific model, providing insights into both the training and testing phases. 
The testing phase involves backtesting to evaluate the model's performance, including a focus on potential Return on Investment (ROI) in the context of stock trading strategies.
